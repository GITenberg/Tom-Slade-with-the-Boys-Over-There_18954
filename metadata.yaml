description: In the southwestern corner of the domains of Kaiser Bill, in a fair district
  to which he has no more right than a highwayman has to his victim's wallet, there
  is a quaint old house built of gray stone and covered with a clinging vine. In the
  good old days when Alsace was a part of France the old house stood there and was
  the scene of joy and plenty. In these evil days when Alsace belongs to Kaiser Bill,
  it stands there, its dim arbor and pretty, flower-laden trellises in strange contrast
  to the lumbering army wagons and ugly, threatening artillery which pass along the
  quiet road. And if the prayers of its rightful owners are answered, it will still
  stand there in the happy days to come when fair Alsace shall be a part of France
  again and Kaiser Bill and all his clanking claptrap are gone from it forever. The
  village in which this pleasant homestead stands is close up under the boundary of
  Rhenish Bavaria, or Germany proper (or improper), and in the happy days when Alsace
  was a part of France it had been known as Leteur, after the French family which
  for generations had lived in the old gray house.
